One of the most interesting LLM-related projects Iâ€™ve worked on is AI-Driven Content Source Identification, which focuses on distinguishing between human-written, AI-generated, and paraphrased text. Given the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT and Grammarly, traditional plagiarism detection methods struggle to verify content authenticity. To address this, I leveraged RoBERTa, ELECTRA, GPT-Neo, and Mistral models, training them on a dataset of over 46,000 text samples sourced from research abstracts and web-scraped human-written content. By fine-tuning these models and applying advanced prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Self-Consistency, I achieved a remarkable 95.73% accuracy with GPT-Neo. This project not only advances AI content detection but also reinforces integrity in academia and professional domains.
